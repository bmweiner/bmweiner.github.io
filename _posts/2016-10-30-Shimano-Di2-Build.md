Felt provides an [Owner's Manual][1] and [Supplemental Manual][2] which covers
component installation and wiring for the IAx. Rather than repeat that info,
this article will outline some specifics for Shimano Di2 and the bottom bracket.

## Shimano Di2

For this build, I used Shimano Ultegra Di2 6870 series. The hardest part was
figuring out which components were needed, here is the complete list:

* FD-6870 Road Bike Front Derailleur Brazed-On
* RD-6870 Road Bike Rear Derailleur 11 Speed
* SW-R671 TT Shifter Set
* ST-6871 TT Brake/Shifter Bar End Set
* EW90-B Cockpit Junction A Box 5-Port
* SM-JC41 Internal Routing Junction B Box (x2)
* SM-BTR2 Internal Battery
* EW-SD50 E-tube Electric Wire (1 x 1000mm, 3 x 500mm, 1 x 300mm)
* BCR2 Internal Battery Charger E-tube

### When Wires Will Not Reach

Both the shifter and brake/shifter sets came with e-tube wires permanently
installed. Unfortunately, the brake/shifter wires were not long enough to reach
the junction A box when routed through the bars/frame. Luckily, a junction B
box can be used to "extend" these wires. Just connect both brake/shifter wires
to a junction B box, then connect that to the junction A box with another wire.

## Bottom bracket
The IA10 is a BB30 frame, but I wanted to use a Shimano crank which has a
different bottom bracket standard (SM-BBR60). To install the crank, I used the
Wheels Mfg BB30 Adapter For Shimano, it fit nicely.
