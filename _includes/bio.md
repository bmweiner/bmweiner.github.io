Hi! My name is Ben Weiner. I am a data analytics manager in the Washington, D.C.
area where I provide consulting services to public sector and industry customers.
My specialty is in designing and delivering data driven products to solve
complex business problems through requirements design, data gathering,
analytics, modeling, and visualization. I work with a variety of open source and 
commercial software to build solutions including Python, R, Java, SAS, and AWS.

I am currently working with the Analytics and Cognitive practice at Deloitte 
Consulting. Some applications of my work include machine learning, data mining, 
simulation, natural language processing, and association analysis. I previously
worked for Booz Allen Hamilton and PTC. I have a B.S. in Industrial and Systems 
Engineering from Virginia Tech and am pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science from 
Johns Hopkins University. For more, head over to my [LinkedIn][linkedin].

In my free time I enjoy conquering [physical challenges][strava], developing
