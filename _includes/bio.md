Hi! My name is Ben Weiner. I'm a management consultant in the Washington, D.C.
area where I provide analytics services to public sector clients,
primarily in health care and security. My specialties include **machine
learning**, **data mining**, and **visualization**. I work with a variety of
open source and commercial software to build solutions including Python, R,
Hadoop, SAS, AWS, and Watson.

I am currently working with the Analytics and Information Management practice -
Advanced Analytics group at Deloitte Consulting. Some applications of my work
include prediction, natural language processing, association analysis, and
advanced visualization. For more, head over to my [LinkedIn][linkedin].

In my free time I enjoy competing in [triathlons][strava], developing
[software][github], and spending time with my better half.
