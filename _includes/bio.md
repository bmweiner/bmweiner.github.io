Hi! My name is Ben Weiner. I am a data science manager in the Washington, D.C.
area. My specialty is in designing and delivering data driven products to solve
complex business problems through requirements design, data gathering,
analytics, modeling, and visualization. I work with a variety of open source and 
commercial software to build solutions including Python, Spark, R, Java, and AWS.

In my current role as a product manager at Capital One, I am responsible for
several Anti-Money Laundering models which risk rate customers and identify
suspicious transaction activity. Prior to this, I worked on many analytics
consulting engagements with federal clients in the health care and security areas,
as a consultant with Deloitte and Booz Allen Hamilton. Some applications of my work
include risk modeling, machine learning, simulation, natural language processing, 
and association analysis. I have a B.S. in Industrial and Systems 
Engineering from Virginia Tech and am pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science from 
Johns Hopkins University. For more, head over to my [LinkedIn][linkedin].
